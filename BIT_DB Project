#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.


#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) AS 'Total Orders' FROM JanSales 
WHERE orderID <> ''
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) AS 'Total iPhones Sold' FROM JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND orderID <> ''
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT cus.acctnum FROM customers cus
INNER JOIN FebSales feb
ON cus.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE orderID <> ''
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT Product, MIN(price) FROM JanSales;


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(Quantity) * price AS Revenue, Product FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product;


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, Quantity, SUM(Quantity) * price AS Revenue FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT acctnum), AVG(Quantity*Price), ROUND(AVG(Quantity*Price)) AS 'Rounded Average'
FROM FebSales feb
JOIN customers cust
ON feb.orderID = order_id
WHERE feb.Quantity > 2
AND order_id <> ''
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

These are questions that I came up with on my own and their solutions.

--Question #1 Which artists appeared more than once on the list?
--SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name) AS 'Number of songs on list' FROM Spotifydata
--GROUP BY artist_name
--HAVING COUNT(artist_name) > 1;

--Question #2 What is the tempo of the top five most popular songs?
--SELECT track_name , popularity,tempo FROM Spotifydata
--ORDER BY popularity DESC
--LIMIT 5;

--Question #3 What is the average danceability of the list?
--SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM Spotifydata;

--Make a CASE statement using the popularity column and assign "How popular" the songs were.
--SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, 
--CASE WHEN popularity >= 90 THEN 'The Most Popular'
--WHEN popularity >= 80 THEN 'Very Popular'
--WHEN popularity >= 70 THEN 'Popular'
--ELSE 'Kinda Popular'
--END AS 'Popular Scale'
--FROM Spotifydata;

--Which 5 songs were the longest?
--SELECT artist_name , track_name , duration_ms
--FROM Spotifydata
--GROUP BY duration_ms
--ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
--LIMIT 5;
